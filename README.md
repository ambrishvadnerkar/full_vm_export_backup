This is the shell/bash script to take manual full vm export backup recursively on shared network drive (NFS drive).
This script need to be run on Citrix XenServer Hypervisor with root user. You must have to specify the valide NFS drive shared within the network. Before backup starts the NFS Drive will be mounted on the Hypervisor and will be unmounted after backup is finish.
